##  Setup and Installation :white_check_mark: <a name="setup-installation"></a>

### Cloning the repo :file_folder:
First off, in order to get a copy of the project in order to run/test it, clone the repository into a folder on your machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:MaycolTeles/mongo-db.git
```

### Creating and Activating the Virtual Environment :open_file_folder:
It is recommended to install the dependencies inside a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). So, inside the folder where you cloned the repository, create a new virtualenv:

```
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```
    
Then, activate the virtualenv (for Linux/MacOS):

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

or (for Windows):

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing Dependencies :wrench:
To install all the necessary project dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating the .env file :spiral_notepad:
In order to run the project, you must create a .env file to store the necessary environment variables (in this case, some database informations).
To do so, open the file named ".env.txt" and follow the instructions inside it to create the .env file.

### Executing the Project :arrow_forward:
```
python app/main.py
```

*********************

## How To Use :man_technologist: <a name="how-to-use"></a>

Just follow the instructions on the terminal. When a number menu is shown, type the number that matches the option that you want. When just the options are shown, type the option that you want.

*********************

## Final Considerations :pushpin: <a name="final-considerations"></a>

To create the "Aula" entity, a builder could be used. Also, the project's architecture and design could be improved as well.
